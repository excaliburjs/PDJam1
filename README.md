# WARNING: Important Note for future explorers

If you’re looking for good examples of how to build games in Excalibur, please visit the [official sample gallery](https://excaliburjs.com/samples/).

We don’t recommend using this game’s source code as an example for your own work
- it was built quickly during a game jam; the code likely cuts a few corners and is a bit messy in some places
- the version of Excalibur it's using is out-of-date; the API has likely changed, and there are newer, better design patterns for building games using the Excalibur engine.

If you’d like to explore for curiosity’s sake, go on ahead, and good luck!
